The knock-on effects of Vladimir Putinâ€™s war on Ukraine are being felt far and wide.

An example is how consumers are having to pay more to heat their homes and drive their cars due to higher oil and gas prices.

That is painful enough in developed countries like the United States and United Kingdom.

Many other developing countries, though, face an even more fundamental crisis - food shortages.

As is well-known, prior to the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for 30% of global wheat exports.


The price of wheat shot up immediately after Russia attacked its neighbour. The price of a bushel of wheat, which produces enough flour to bake 70 1lb loaves of white bread or 90 1lb loaves of wholemeal bread, shot up from $8.84 on the ever of the invasion to just under $13.64 on 8 March. It has since eased to $11.58 this morning - but that still represents an increase of more than 25% and is higher than it has been for the best part of a decade.

That would be bad enough for big wheat importers.

Making matters worse, though, is that Ukraine is now struggling to get its wheat out of the country. Ukraine still has some 20 million tonnes of wheat and corn left to export from the 2021-22 season that cannot be exported because Russia is blockading ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, leaving 100 foreign vessels stranded.

Mykola Gorbachev, chairman of the Ukrainian Grain Association, said: "We are sitting on a potential loss of $6bn."

To put that into context, Ukraine's total grain exports last year totalled $27bn.
The implications for those countries that buy Ukrainian wheat are terrifying. They include the likes of Indonesia, Egypt - the world's biggest wheat importer - Pakistan, Tunisia and Morocco. Deprived of Ukrainian wheat, they will have to seek alternatives, costing them more.

Those suffering the most will be the world's poorest people. The United Nations Food Programme, which feeds 125 million of the world's hungriest souls, sources around half of its grain from Ukraine.

David Beasley, the WFP's executive director, said last week that both soaring food prices and lower wheat exports as a result of the war threatened to create a global catastrophe.
